## Course Experience

If you like a more "course-experience" rather than watching videos, we also have our courses on Udemy and other platforms. For example, this is from the Course "Ethereum Blockchain Developer -- Build Projects in Solidity", over here <https://www.udemy.com/course/blockchain-developer/?referralCode=E8611DF99D7E491DFD96>
