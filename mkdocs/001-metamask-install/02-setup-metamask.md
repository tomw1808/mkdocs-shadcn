    A seed phrase (or here: Backup Phrase) is usually a number of human-readable words (e.g. 12 words). This represents the "master key" to regain access to all your accounts. It is a simple algorithm to create a number of private keys based on your backup phrase. Don't worry if you don't know yet what this means - just remember: Never (like __never ever__) give out your seed phrase!
