# MetaMask Behind the Scenes

In this video we're talking what happens behind the scenes when you connect to MetaMask.

Right now, you're probably familiar with the Ethereum blockchain and the popular MetaMask browser extension. But did you know that you can use Infura to easily access the Ethereum network without having to run a full node?

Infura is a global infrastructure provider for decentralized applications (DApps). It allows developers to connect to the Ethereum network without running a full node, making it easier and faster to build DApps. Plus, Infura is free for developers!

MetaMask is an easy way for developers to get started building DApps on the Ethereum blockchain. With MetaMask, you can create and manage your own wallets, send transactions, and explore contracts. And now with support for Infura, connecting to the Ethereum network has never been easier!
