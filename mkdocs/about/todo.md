# ToDo List

MkDocs-Shadcn was built in like two measle weekends. The first version, anyways.

A project like this will never be "feature complete", however, there are a few features missing to make it a "stable" version.

!!! quote "Jim Simons"
    Be guided by beauty. I really mean that.

I do like a beautiful architecture. If things look good, are well architected, work fast and seamless, its just more pleasant to use. Therefore, a few things are missing in MkDocs-Shadcn to make it beautiful and stable. A non-exhaustive list, in no particular order:

1. MetaData parsing, like creation or last updated
2. Support for Tables
3. Tooltips and Annotations
4. A better NavBar (both sidepanel and main-nav). Meaning, a better structure, maybe not rely on the Sidepanel function from shadcn but copy what they're using on their own website so its having a max-width that resembles the continer class somehow.
5. Images with titles and descriptions. Something like a card of sorts. In general, image support is very poor, despite the LightBox.
6. Social Card and OpenGraph images etc.
7. Multi Language
8. Documentation-Versioning
9. A better handling of the folder structure. That is, have the same folder structure as in the original MkDocs with a docs sub-folder
10. Actually functioning code-highlighting and titles
11. A better markdown parser which is not just a bunch of regular expressions made by mediocrates.
12. Hot-Reload functionality for Markdown file edits (I think this might work: https://www.steveruiz.me/posts/nextjs-refresh-content, but really, it also doesn't look very "elegant")
13. A sidenav that is not collapsed on the first level
14. Images in the sidenav via the graymatter of the markdown
15. There is no right-handed in-document navigation yet

## Pull Requests

If you want to work on a feature: fork the repo, work on it, send me a PR. Let's not overcomplicate things. The project is very young, might never be picked up by anyone anyways, so ... let's keep it real here.
