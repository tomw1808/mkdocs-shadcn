# Getting Started

## Project Structure

The project follows a specific structure to maintain compatibility with MkDocs Material while providing enhanced features:

```
your-project/
├── mkdocs/              # Your documentation root
│   ├── mkdocs.yml      # MkDocs configuration file
│   └── docs/           # Documentation markdown files
│       └── **/*.md     # Markdown files in any subdirectory
├── components/         # React components
├── lib/               # Utility functions
└── public/            # Public assets
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Create the basic directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p mkdocs/docs
```

2. Place your `mkdocs.yml` file in the `mkdocs` directory.

3. Place all your markdown files in the `mkdocs/docs` directory, maintaining your desired structure.

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your documentation site.

## MkDocs Material Compatibility

This project is designed as a drop-in replacement for MkDocs Material. You can take any existing MkDocs Material project and:

1. Copy your existing `mkdocs.yml` into the `mkdocs` directory
2. Copy your markdown files into the `mkdocs/docs` directory
3. Run the development server

Everything should work as expected, with the added benefits of Next.js performance and modern features.
